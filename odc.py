ODC is a Python library for detecting and treating outliers in time-series data.
It can be used to clean various types of variables, including on-stream hours for
production and injection data, production rates, injection rates, average choke size,
 reservoir pressure and temperature, and wellhead temperature.

ODC is built on top of the Pandas library and is compatible with NumPy and Matplotlib.

class DetectOutliers:

    """
    This class is designed to identify, visualize, and remove outliers
    in time series data from oil wells.
    We have tested the outlier detection capability of this class on a
      daily time series dataset retrieved
      from the VOLVE field provided by Equinor (formerly known as Statoil).
    `The index of the input DataFrame must be a pandas DatetimeIndex object.`

    The class can clean four types of variables:

    - `on_stream_var`: Indicates the on-stream hours for production or injection wells.
    - `rate_var`: Indicates the production rate, such as oil, water, or gas, and
      can also be used for injection rate, such as water injected volume.
    - `avg_choke_var`: Indicates the average choke size (valve) that controls the production rates.
    - `roc`: Denotes the rate of change. The `detect_outliers_with_roc` method in this class
        can clean variables that behave in a relatively stable or gradual manner
          (e.g. average reservoir pressure
        and temperature and average wellhead temperature as well).

        The function, that detects outliers based on roc, works by identifying sudden movements
          that do not conform to
        the distribution of observations within the specified window. Each window contains
        a certain number of observations selected based on the window size, which can be
          defined by the user.

        The default values in all methods have been determined based on experimental results
            and have been optimized for outlier detection and removal.However, the user can
              change the default values.

    Parameters:
    ----------
        data (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame that contains the oil time series
          data to be cleaned.


    Attributes:
    ----------
        data (pd.DataFrame): A copy of the input data.

        Detect outliers based on the defined rate of change by the user.

        The method first validates if the input rate of change conforms to the expected format.
          It then calculates the mean for each window of data points, and generates a boundary
          for each window based on the user-defined rate of change and the calculated mean.
            Data points that fall outside these boundaries are identified as outliers.

            `window_size (int)`: The number of data points to include in the window.

        - Determine the rate of change for each window based on the quantile.

              the same user-defined rate of change value is used for all windows.
            The user should input only one value, which will be used to calculate the outliers
